### Materials List

1. **Microcontroller**:
   - Raspberry Pi Pico

2. **Actuators**:
   - Servo motors (suitable for pressing strings)

3. **Power Supply**:
   - USB power supply or battery pack

4. **Sensors/Inputs**:
   - Push buttons (one for each chord or a rotary encoder for multiple chords)
   - Optional: Resistors (for button pull-down or pull-up configuration)

5. **Mechanical Components**:
   - 3D printed parts or other materials for the pressing mechanism
   - Connecting rods or linkages

6. **Mounting Hardware**:
   - Screws, nuts, bolts, and brackets

7. **Wiring**:
   - Jumper wires for connections
   - Breadboard for prototyping (if needed)

8. **Software Tools**:
   - Thonny IDE (for coding in Python)
   - Libraries for servo control (e.g., `machine` and `utime`)

9. **Optional**:
   - LED indicators to show which chord is currently selected

### Suggested Approach

1. **Button Setup**:
   - Connect buttons to GPIO pins on the Pico. Use pull-down or pull-up resistors to ensure stable readings.
   - Each button can correspond to a different chord or action.

2. **Servo Control**:
   - Write code to control the servos based on button presses. You might have a function that moves the servo to the correct position for each chord.

3. **User Interface**:
   - If you use multiple buttons, consider adding LEDs to indicate which chord is currently selected.

4. **Testing**:
   - Start by testing individual components (like the servos and buttons) to ensure they work before integrating everything.

5. **Final Assembly**:
   - Once everything is working, assemble it into a compact design that fits well with the guitar.
