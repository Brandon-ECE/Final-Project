Matterials List 
- Raspberry Pi Pico
- 3 Servo motors
- 3 Joysticks
- 3D Printed Parts 
- Mounting Hardware
- Jumper Wires
- Thonny Coding (Python)

Start Up Plan
-Joystick Setup:
Connect joysticks to GPIO pins on the Pico.Each joysticks can correspond to a different chord or action.

-Servo Control:
Writen code to control the servos based on joysticks angle of motion.

-Testing:
Start by testing individual components (like the servos and joysticks) to ensure they work before integrating everything.

Final Assembly:
Once everything is working, assemble it into a compact design that fits well with the guitar.
