Start Up Plan
-Joystick Setup
   - Connect joysticks to GPIO pins on the Pico. Use pull-down or pull-up resistors to ensure stable readings.
   - Each button can correspond to a different chord or action.

2. **Servo Control**:
   - Write code to control the servos based on button presses. 

3. **User Interface**:
   - If you use multiple buttons, consider adding LEDs to indicate which chord is currently selected.

4. **Testing**:
   - Start by testing individual components (like the servos and buttons) to ensure they work before integrating everything.

5. **Final Assembly**:
   - Once everything is working, assemble it into a compact design that fits well with the guitar.
